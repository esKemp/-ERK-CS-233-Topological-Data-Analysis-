classdef Basis < dynamicprops
    % Provides a common set of functions that every class that inherits the Basis class, must implement.
    % Furthemore, it implements some of these functions and allows them to be used its subclasses. Known
    % subclasses of the Basis class include the Laplacian and the Laplace_Beltrami.
