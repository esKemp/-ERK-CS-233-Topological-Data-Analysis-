FmapLib -- An efficient implementation of the Functional Map Framework
======================================================================

FmapLib is an efficient Matlab implementation of the Functional Map Framework, which 
was introduced in the seminal paper "Functional Maps: a flexible representation
of maps between shapes" by M. Ovsjanikov, et al. in SIGGRAPH 2012.

Our implementation follows the Object Oriented Programming and provides classes to abstract modalities such as: Images, 3D Meshes and Graphs. 

This way, one can infer and manipulate Functional Maps, among all the modalities that have currently been explored in the literature in a straightforward way.
